                    <h2>Brief Explaination</h2>
                    <h1>Why the Costa Diadema Had to End This Way</h1>
                    <h6 id="author-tag" class="transition">- IVASTZ</h6>
                    <div id="explaination">
                        <p>It is rather obvious that the public release of the beloved Costa Diadema is <mark>out of my character</mark>. Therefore, I am a strong believer that a well-composed explaination is required to understand why any of this happened in the first place.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How It Started</h3>
                        <p>The idea of this release did not come suddenly. The idea originated after <mark>multiple sources, both in and out of Costa Cruises</mark>, (whose names will remain annoynmous) waved many red flags to the group's new owners. Most sources pinpointed one new owner in particular. <mark>OB2N, the new Chief Executive Officer of Costa Cruises, was flagged for his reputation to sell and reproduce assets from groups he acquired</mark>. In addition to, others highlighted his rigorious past, including screenshots of him using slurs, homophobic remarks, and much more. While all of the screenshots were valuable data, the idea that stuck out most to me was that the <mark>Costa Diadema was at risk of being sold commercially for OB2N's own benefit</mark>.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>The Intent</h3>
                        <p>So after hearing this swell of news, I began looking into the legitimate of these sources. Immediately I found <mark>a number of old projects by OB2N that had been sold off</mark> since they failed to catch popularity or his motivation. With this finding, it only sounded my alarms more as I now have a clear understanding that Costa Cruises, and all of its assets, was destined for the same path of destruction. So like the tortise and the hare, I began slow-and-steadly preparing for this release. I deep dived and reworked roughly 80+ scripts in game, created a single module that ran the games permissions, and fixed up other aspects of the game itself.</p>
                        <p>It right before this deep dive, which started roughly one month ago, that another fire erupted. After the the selling of DuhZander's share and weeks into OB2N's ownership the ship's file would be leaked, including all of the scripts. This leaking was marked as "iVastz's blessing." Although at that time I had no involvement into the issue, I was targeted almost immediately. Keep in mind, at the time I had not checked into rocruising for a while and only knew of his ownership. So with my notifications blowing up, I checked and examined the issue. It was during this drama that I would join a voice call with OB2N and his crew. Almost immediately, they took me as suspect. After extensive minutes of explaining that I had no involvement into the issue and that I was in-fact working while it took place, they still failed to understand. When I mentioned that there is no evidence in my involvement, they kept a blind eye. I would then be banned from Costa Cruises a few days later, never allowed to return.</p>
                        <p>While the ban itself did not affect me, their responses made it even more clear that <mark>they could in-fact sway into selling assets</mark>. So I pushed harder into the plan and started the countdown.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p><mark>Now I <b>DO NOT</b> ask for pity or forgiveness</mark>, as what I have committed will be damaging. However, I believe that some sort of action was necessary. Although the beloved Costa Diadema has ended this way, I believe that an individual will come along to learn from the ship that apply that same knowledge for the improvement of Ro-Cruising as a whole.</p>
                        <p>All-in-all, this is why the Costa Diadema had to end this way.</p>
